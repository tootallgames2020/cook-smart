## Core Principle: Get It Right the First Time

**Never create markdown files with formatting issues.** Always produce clean, properly formatted markdown that passes all linting checks on the first attempt. This prevents wasted time, backtracking, and credit consumption from fixing avoidable issues.

## RULES

You MUST follow these rules when creating or editing markdown files:

1. You MUST end markdown files with a single newline (`\n` not `\n\n`)
2. You MUST run getDiagnostics immediately after creating/editing any .md file
3. You MUST fix all linting errors before proceeding to other tasks
4. You MUST NOT use multiple consecutive blank lines (causes MD012 errors)
5. You MUST NOT proceed without fixing MD047 errors

## How Kiro Will Write Markdown

### Mandatory Workflow

When creating or editing any .md files, follow this exact sequence:

1. **Write properly formatted content** following the standards below
2. **fsWrite(text="content\n\n")** - ALWAYS include empty line in text parameter (NEVER forget this - prevents MD047)
3. **Run getDiagnostics immediately** after creating/editing
4. **Fix any remaining issues in the same operation** - never proceed with linting errors

### Formatting Requirements

### File Structure

- **Empty line at end**: Always include an empty line after your last content line
- **Simple prevention**: End fsWrite text with an empty line to avoid MD047 errors
- **Consistent heading hierarchy**: Use proper H1 → H2 → H3 progression
- **Unique headings**: Each heading must be unique (avoid duplicate text)
- **Proper headings**: Use heading syntax, not bold text for section titles

### Spacing Rules

- **Blank lines around headings**: Add blank lines before and after all headings
- **Blank lines around lists**: Required for MD032 compliance
- **Consistent paragraph spacing**: Single blank line between paragraphs
- **No multiple consecutive blank lines**: Never use multiple blank lines in a row (causes MD012 errors)

### Content Standards

- **Clear, descriptive headings**: Make headings self-explanatory
- **Proper list formatting**: Use consistent bullet/number styles
- **Code block formatting**: Use proper fencing with language tags

### Standard Template

```markdown
# Document Title

## Main Section

Content paragraph with proper spacing.

### Subsection

- List item with proper spacing
- Another list item

More content here.

## Another Section

Final content.
```

## What This Prevents

- **MD047 errors** from missing trailing newlines
- **MD012 errors** from multiple consecutive blank lines
- **MD032 errors** from improper spacing around lists
- **MD025 errors** from multiple H1 headings
- **Linting failures** that waste time and credits
- **Rework cycles** from formatting issues caught in CI/CD

## Efficiency Rules

- **Zero tolerance for formatting issues**: Fix everything before proceeding
- **Immediate diagnostics**: Always check after file operations
- **Handle MD047 systematically**: Use the strReplace method for trailing newlines
- **Single-pass completion**: Get it right the first time, every time
- **Prevent rework**: Proper formatting saves time and credits

## Tool-Specific Instructions

### For fsWrite

Always include exactly one empty line at the end of your content:

```python
WRONG: fsWrite(path="file.md", text="Final sentence.")
WRONG: fsWrite(path="file.md", text="Final sentence.\n\n\n")  # Multiple blank lines
RIGHT: fsWrite(path="file.md", text="Final sentence.\n\n")
```

The text should end with your content, then exactly one empty line (`\n\n`). Do not add extra spaces, newlines, or blank lines after `\n\n` as this creates multiple consecutive blank lines and triggers MD012 errors.

### For MD047 Errors (Reliable Method)

When getDiagnostics shows MD047, use strReplace with literal empty line in newStr:

```python
strReplace(path="file.md", oldStr="last line content", newStr="last line content.

")
```

The newStr must end with an actual empty line (line break in the string), not `\n`.

## 🚨 FINAL REMINDERS 🚨

- **MD047 Prevention**: Always end fsWrite text with `\n\n` (one empty line) or you WILL get MD047 errors
- **MD012 Prevention**: Never add extra blank lines after `\n\n` or you WILL get MD012 errors (multiple consecutive blank lines)
- **The pattern**: `text="Your last line of content.\n\n"` - nothing after the second `\n`
